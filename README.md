# Benchmark 4. Benchmark on the relevance of LCA to improve one's competences of engineering for sustainability
This benchmark is under construction. So not all the sections are completed (especially the cartography)
The objective of the benchmark is to analyze the increase in skills in sustainability engineering of people who carry out a collaborative life cycle assessment approach.

## Glossary
To share a common understanding of ambiguous concepts, contributors shall agree upon the following definitions:
* Strong sustainability: definition taken from (Dietz and Neumayer, 2007). Natural capital is non-substitutable as it is a primary value to human welfare.
* "Projet Oasis" (used in 1 dataset): https://www.colibris-lemouvement.org/projets/projet-oasis 
* Competence: a complex knowledge of acting based on the effective mobilization and use of a variety of resources (Tardif, 2003)

## Requirements
Characterization of the dataset: study a transition phenomenon (before, during, after). Compare different ways of applying the LCA method.

## Solutions to be compared
### Solution 1: Performing a LCA using the openLCA software
### Solution 2: Performing a LCA using the openLCA software and a collaborative board

## Measures of Performance
The analysis tool is a grid of sustainability engineering skills from (Quelhas et al., 2019). The 8 skills used as an analysis tool are:
* Critical thinking
* Working in interdisciplinary group
* Ability to solve problems
* Systemic thinking
* Normative competence
* Self-knowledge
* Contextualisation and vision of the future (anticipation)
* Strategic competence
The results of each of the competence for every person are gathered thanks to a survey or an interview.

To evalute each of the comptence, we used the same grid. The analysis was done before, during and after the lifecycle analysis process. This difference is measured according to the grid proposed by the Ministry of National Education (Ministère de l'enseignement, 2011) at 4 levels:
* Level 1: The content relates to the understanding of an overview of a subject: the realities are shown under cert
* Level 2: The content relates to the acquisition of means of expression and communication: define, use the terms making up the discipline. It is about mastering "learned" knowledge. This level includes the previous one.
* Level 3: The content relates to the mastery of study or action tools: use, manipulate rules or sets of rules (algorithm), principles, formalized procedures with a view to a result to be achieved. This level includes the two previous levels.
* Level 4: The content relates to the mastery of a methodology for formulating and solving problems: assembling, organizing the elements of a subject, identifying the relationships, reasoning from these relationships, deciding with a view to a goal to reach. It is about mastering an approach: induce, deduce, experiment, document yourself. This level encompasses the three previous levels.

Level 0 is added when the skill has never been addressed.
The Ø level is added when the person did not know how to answer.

## Datasets
### Dataset 1: performing a LCA with non-experts
The descriptive file of the first dataset will be available soon (need to be translated and validated by the stakeholders of the experiment).
The file will contain the tables of the competencies of participants before and after the LCA process. 
Work is underway on the anonymization of the interviews carried out and the publication of these interviews in scientific data repositories. The interviews should be available within a year. 

### Dataset 2: performing a LCA with M2 students on enginnering for sustainability
Students performing LCA with openLCA software
