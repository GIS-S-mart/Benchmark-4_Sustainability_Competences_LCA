# Benchmark 4. Benchmark on the relevance of LCA to improve one's competences of engineering for sustainability
The objective of the benchmark is to analyze the ability of a population who carry out a life cycle assessment to acquire engineering for sustainability competencies. 
Any person why teach or pratice LCA with a specific population (students, companies, non experts) can participate to this benchmark, take the data to analyse them, complete the data with other experiments.
Possible outputs of the benchmark: identifing teaching methods for LCA, improving the metod process to collect the data regarding the competencies of students.

## Glossary
To share a common understanding of ambiguous concepts, contributors shall agree upon the following definitions:
* Strong sustainability: definition taken from (Dietz and Neumayer, 2007). Natural capital is non-substitutable as it is a primary value to human welfare.
* Competence: a complex knowledge of acting based on the effective mobilization and use of a variety of resources (Tardif, 2003)

## Requirements



## Positioning of the solutions
This table details the different results obtained by the previous experiment. It will help you define which solution correspond to which dataset.
If you have deployed a data collection protocol following the method described in this benchmark, feel free to contribute.

## Measures of Performance
The analysis tool is a grid of sustainability engineering skills from (Quelhas et al., 2019). The 8 skills used as an analysis tool are:
* Critical thinking
* Working in interdisciplinary group
* Ability to solve problems
* Systemic thinking
* Normative competence
* Self-knowledge
* Contextualisation and vision of the future (anticipation)
* Strategic competence
The results of each of the competence for every person are gathered thanks to a survey or an interview.

To evalute each of the comptence, we used the same grid. The analysis was done before, during and after the lifecycle analysis process. This difference is measured according to the grid proposed by the Ministry of National Education (Ministère de l'enseignement, 2011) at 4 levels:
* Level 1: The content relates to the understanding of an overview of a subject: the realities are shown under cert
* Level 2: The content relates to the acquisition of means of expression and communication: define, use the terms making up the discipline. It is about mastering "learned" knowledge. This level includes the previous one.
* Level 3: The content relates to the mastery of study or action tools: use, manipulate rules or sets of rules (algorithm), principles, formalized procedures with a view to a result to be achieved. This level includes the two previous levels.
* Level 4: The content relates to the mastery of a methodology for formulating and solving problems: assembling, organizing the elements of a subject, identifying the relationships, reasoning from these relationships, deciding with a view to a goal to reach. It is about mastering an approach: induce, deduce, experiment, document yourself. This level encompasses the three previous levels.

2 levels have been added: 
* Level 0 is added when the skill has never been addressed.
* The Ø level is added when the person did not know how to answer ('I don't know' in the table)

## Dataset
The dataset is the method to follow to get the results.

## Results
### Solution 1: Performing a LCA using the openLCA software and a collaborative board with M2 students following a master on engineering of the environment and sustainable development
